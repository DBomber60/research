```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction/ Motivation

Suppose we have results from several experiments on the effect of the same drug. That is, for each of $J$ experiments, we have an estimated effect and standard error, $(y_j, \sigma_j)$. How should we combine these data into an overall effect estimate and what is the error of the overall effect?


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
